            One major problem they identified was the heightened risks of data
            breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive customer information,
            including personal and financial data. This was further exaggerated
            by the possibilities of increasingly sophisticated phishing and
            social engineering attacks targeting employees and customers, posing
            risks of credential theft and fraud. Another threat looming over the
            business was the growing prevalence of ransomware and malware
            attacks that had the potential to disrupt business operations and
            compromise data integrity and availability.
